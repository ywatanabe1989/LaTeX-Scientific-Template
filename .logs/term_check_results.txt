  Missing definition for "Sternberg task" at its first occurrence.
  Suggestion: Define "Sternberg task" at its first occurrence, even if it was defined in the abstract.

  Missing definition for "Gaussian-process factor analysis (GPFA)" at its first occurrence.
  Suggestion: Define "Gaussian-process factor analysis (GPFA)" at its first occurrence, even if it was defined in the abstract.

  "sharp-wave ripples" and "SWR" usage is inconsistent.
  Suggestion: Decide on one abbreviation/term and use it consistently throughout the section.
