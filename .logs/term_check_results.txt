- Abstract Line 15-16
  "the NT distance between the encoding and retrieval phases was dependent on the memory load."
  -> "the distance of neural trajectories (NTs) between the encoding and retrieval phases was dependent on the memory load."
  Reason: Abbreviation 'NTs' not consistently introduced; previously mentioned as 'NT'.

- Introduction Line 10
  "sharp-wave ripples" -> "sharp-wave ripples (SWRs)"
  Reason: Abbreviation 'SWRs' not introduced at first occurrence in main text.

- Introduction Line 17
  "neural trajectories" -> "neural trajectories (NTs)"
  Reason: Abbreviation 'NTs' not introduced at first occurrence in main text.

- Introduction Line 36-37
  "Gaussian-process factor analysis" -> "Gaussian-process factor analysis (GPFA)"
  Reason: Abbreviation 'GPFA' not introduced at first occurrence in main text.

- Results Line 8
  "sharp-wave ripples (SWR$^+$)" -> "sharp-wave ripples (SWRs)"
  Reason: Abbreviation 'SWRs' should be used after the introduction and use of 'SWR$^+$' is inconsistent.

- Results Line 49:
  Replace "$^+$" with "SWR$^+$" and "$^-$" with "SWR$^-$" throughout lines where these symbols first occur.
  Reason: Abbreviations for "sharp wave-ripple" events are inconsistent, and the symbols alone do not provide clear definition upon first use within the Results section.

- Results Line 48-49
  "sharp wave-ripple (SWR$^+$)" -> "sharp wave-ripple (SWR)"
  Reason: In the introduction, 'SWRs' is defined; hence 'SWR$^+$' as per the instructions should be written in its abbreviated form 'SWR'.

- Results Line 98-99
  "representations or neural trajectories" -> "representations or neural trajectories (NTs)"
  Reason: The abbreviation 'NTs' is not defined at the first mention in the Results section.

- Methods Line 39-40
  "sharp-wave ripples" -> "sharp-wave ripples (SWRs)"
  Reason: Abbreviation 'SWRs' not introduced at the first occurrence in the Methods section.

- Methods Line 47
  "Gaussian-Process Factor Analysis" -> "Gaussian-Process Factor Analysis (GPFA)"
  Reason: Abbreviation 'GPFA' not introduced at the first occurrence in the Methods section.

- Discussion Line 14
  "Neural trajectories" -> "Neural trajectories (NTs)"
  Reason: Inconsistency in the use of the abbreviation 'NTs'.

- Discussion Line 14-15
  "sharp-wave ripple (SWR)" -> "sharp-wave ripple (SWRs)"
  Reason: Inconsistent abbreviation usage; should be consistent with the introduction 'SWRs'.

- Discussion Line 16
  "working memory (WM)" -> "working memory"
  Reason: Abbreviation 'WM' already introduced in the abstract and does not need to be redefined here in the Discussion.

- Discussion Line 24-26
  "putative CA1 regions (Figure~\ref{fig:04})" -> "putative CA1 regions"
  Reason: Unnecessary detail for referencing the figure within the Discussion text regarding term consistency.

- Discussion Line 37:
  "which was found to be memory load-dependent (Figure~\ref{fig:03})" -> "which was found to be memory load-dependent"
  Reason: Unnecessary detail for referencing the figure within the Discussion text regarding term consistency.

- Discussion Line 45-46
  Sharps should be removed from SWR$^+$ and SWR$^-$ since they represent sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) and control events, respectively.
  Reason: Inconsistency in usage and unnecessary detail for referencing figure within the Discussion text regarding term consistency.
