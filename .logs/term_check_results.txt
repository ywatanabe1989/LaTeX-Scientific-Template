- Abstract Line 7-8:
  "low-dimensional neural representations or trajectories (NT)" -> "neural trajectories (NTs)"
  Reason: Inconsistency in abbreviation usage

- Abstract Line 13-14:
  "transient and synchronous oscillation" -> "transient and synchronous oscillations"
  Reason: Grammatical number agreement

- Introduction Paragraph 1 Line 14:
  "Understanding the hippocampusâ€™ role in working memory" -> "Understanding the hippocampus's role in working memory"
  Reason: Style consistency in possession

- Introduction Paragraph 2 Line 3:
  "The associations suggest that SWR" -> "These associations suggest that SWRs"
  Reason: Abbreviation plural form inconsistency

- Introduction Paragraph 4 Line 6:
  "rodent movement complicates" -> "rodent movements complicate"
  Reason: Grammatical number agreement

- Methods Paragraph 4 Line 3:
  "During the encoding phase, participants were presented" -> "During the encoding phase, participants presented"
  Reason: Verb tense consistency

- Methods Paragraph 5 Line 1:
  "Multiunit spike timing was determined" -> "Multiunit spike timings were determined"
  Reason: Grammatical number agreement

- Methods Paragraph 5 Line 1-2:
  "(Figure~\ref{fig:01}C)." -> "(see Figure~\ref{fig:01}C)."
  Reason: Consistent reference style

- Methods Paragraph 6 Line 4:
  "For each NT within a region such as AHL, geometric medians ($}$ for fixation" -> "For each NT within a region, such as AHL, geometric medians ($}_\text{fix}$ for fixation"
  Reason: Consistency in mathematical notation

- Methods Paragraph 8 Line 1-2:
  "Potential SWR events within the hippocampus were detected using a widely used method" -> "Potential SWR events were detected within the hippocampus using a widely used method"
  Reason: Clarity and word order

- Methods Paragraph 9 Line 1:
  "Potential SWRs were differentiated from SWR candidates" -> "Potential SWRs were distinguished from SWR candidates"
  Reason: Word choice for clarity

- Results Paragraph 1 Line 2:
  ", which comprises LFP signals" -> ", comprising LFP signals"
  Reason: Grammatical structure consistency

- Results Paragraph 2 Line 7:
  "Hipp.), entorhinal cortex (EC), and amygdala (Amy.), plotted" -> "Hipp.), the entorhinal cortex (EC), and the amygdala (Amy.), plotted"
  Reason: Consistency in naming conventions

- Results Paragraph 3 Line 7:
  "(Figure~\ref{fig:03}D and \ref{fig:s02})." -> "(see Figure~\ref{fig:03}D and Figure~\ref{fig:s02})."
