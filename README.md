## LaTeX Installation on Ubuntu

To install neccessary pacakges on Ubuntu, run [`./.scripts/sh/install_on_ubuntu.sh`](./.scripts/sh/install_on_ubuntu.sh) as follows:

```bash
$ ./.scripts/sh/install_on_ubuntu.sh
```

## How to use?

``` bash
$ ./compile.sh
$ ./compile.sh -d # Take diff between the last one [-d|--diff]
$ ./compile.sh -r # Revise tex files written in ./configs/files_to_revise.txt [-r|--revise]
$ ./compile.sh -i # Insert citations into files written in ./configs/files_to_revise.txt based on ./bibliography.bib [-i|-insert-citations]
$ ./compile.sh -- # Commit all and push this repository to GitHub [-p|--push]
```
Logs will be stored at [`./.logs/compile.log`](./.logs/compile.log).

[`./compile.sh`](./.scripts/sh/compile.sh): Compiles the tex and bib files to generate [`./compiled.pdf`](./compiled.pdf) and [`./compiled.tex`](./compiled.tex).

## Which Files to Edit?

Files under the [`./src/`](./src/) directory might be sufficient.

## Project Structure (tree)
See [`./.tree.txt`](./.tree.txt), which is automatically generated by running [`./compiled.sh`](./compiled.sh).
