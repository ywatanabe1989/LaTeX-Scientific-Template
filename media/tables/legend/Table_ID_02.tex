The silhouette score of UMAP clustering between $SWR^+$ candidates and $SWR^-$ candidates

\\
The silhouette scores (mean ± SD for sessions by subject) of UMAP clustering on SWR+ candidates and SWR− candidates (Figure 4A) were based on their underlying multiunit spike patterns (mean values were 0.205 [0.285], median [IQR]; Figure 4B).
