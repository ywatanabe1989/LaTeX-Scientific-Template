\textbf{\textit{A.}} Distance from the origin ($O$) of the peri-sharp-wave-ripple trajectory (mean \textpm 95\% confidence interval; however, the interval may not be easily visible due to the narrow range.).  \textbf{\textit{B.}}  The distance from the origin during the mid-SWR$^+$ period was found to be longer compared to the corresponding pre-SWR$^+$ period (*\textit{p} $<$ 0.05, **\textit{p} $<$ 0.01, ***\textit{p} $<$ 0.001; Brunner--Munzel test). Abbreviations: SWR, sharp-wave ripple events; eSWR, SWR during the encoding phase; rSWR, SWR during the retrieval phase, SWR$^+$, SWR event; SWR$^-$ control events for SWR$^+$; pre-SWR, mid-SWR, or post-SWR, the time interval from $-800$ to $-250$ ms, from $-250$ to $+250$ ms, or from $+250$ to $+800$ ms from the center of SWR.
