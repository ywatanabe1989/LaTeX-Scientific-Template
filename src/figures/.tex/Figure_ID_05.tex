\textbf{\textit{A.}} Distance from the origin ($O$) of the peri-sharp-wave-ripple trajectory (mean \textpm 95\% confidence interval, although the intervals might not be visible due to their narrow ranges. \textbf{\textit{B.}}  The distance from the origin ($O$) during pre-, mid-, and post-SWR periods (*\textit{p} $<$ 0.05, **\textit{p} $<$ 0.01, ***\textit{p} $<$ 0.001; Brunner--Munzel test). Abbreviations: SWR, sharp-wave ripple events; eSWR, SWR during the encoding phase; rSWR, SWR during the retrieval phase, SWR$^+$, SWR event; SWR$^-$ control events for SWR$^+$; pre-, mid-, or post-SWR, the time interval from $-800$ to $-250$ ms, from $-250$ to $+250$ ms, or from $+250$ to $+800$ ms relative to SWR center.
