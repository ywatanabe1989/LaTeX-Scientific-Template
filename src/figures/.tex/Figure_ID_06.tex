\textbf{\textit{A.}} Hippocampal neural trajectories during pre- (\textit{gray}), mid- (\textit{yellow}), and post-SWR$^-$ (\textit{black}) in Match IN (\textit{left}) and Mismatch OUT task (\textit{right}). \textbf{\textit{B.}} The equivalents for SWR$^+$ instead of SWR$^-$, though mid-SWR$^+$ is depicted with \textit{purple}. All data points underwent adjustments and rotations to fit a two-dimensional representation, positioning $\mathrm{g_{E}}$ at (0, 0) and $\mathrm{g_{R}}$ at ($\lVert \mathrm{g_{E}g_{R}} \rVert$, 0). The $\lVert \mathrm{g_{E}g_{R}} \rVert$ metric varies across sessions, and its median \textpm IQR (with medians approximately 0.2) is presented on the x-axes. Note: some intervals might be challenging to discern because of their narrow range. In this two-dimensional depiction, both the distances and angles preserve their relationships as in the original three-dimensional space. Abbreviations: SWR, sharp-wave ripple events; eSWR, SWR during the encoding phase; rSWR, SWR during the retrieval phase, SWR$^+$, SWR event; SWR$^-$ control events for SWR$^+$; pre-SWR, mid-SWR, or post-SWR, the time interval from $-800$ to $-250$ ms, from $-250$ to $+250$ ms, or from $+250$ to $+800$ ms from the center of SWR.
