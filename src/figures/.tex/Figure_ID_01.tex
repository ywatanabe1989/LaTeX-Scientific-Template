Local Field Potentials (LFP), Multiunit Activity, and Neural Trajectories in the Hippocampus During a Modified Sternberg Task
}

\textbf{\textit{A.}} These traces show representative wideband LFP intracranial EEG (iEEG) signals recorded from the left hippocampal head. The subject performed a modified Sternberg working memory task, which includes fixation (1 s, \textit{gray}), encoding (2 s, \textit{blue}), maintenance (3 s, \textit{green}), and retrieval (2 s, \textit{red}). \textbf{\textit{B.}} We then present the corresponding ripple band LFP traces. \textbf{\textit{C.}} The raster plot depicts multiunit spikes taken from the LFP traces, sorted using a spike algorithm \cite{niediek_reliable_2016}. \textbf{\textit{D.}} Subsequently, we illustrate the neural trajectories, which are calculated by GPFA on spike counts per unit with 50-ms bins. Each phase's geometric median is marked by the dot circles. \textbf{\textit{E.}} The trajectory's distance from the origin $O$ is portrayed, with \textit{purple} and \textit{yellow} rectangles indicating the timings for SWR$^+$ candidates and SWR$^-$ candidates (considered as controls for SWR$^+$), respectively.
