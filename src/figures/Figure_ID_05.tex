Transient Alterations in Neural Trajectory During SWR Events

\\
\textbf{\textit{A.}} Displayed is the distance from origin ($O$) of the peri-sharp-wave-ripple trajectory (mean \textpm 95\% confidence interval). The intervals may not be apparent due to their slender ranges. \textbf{\textit{B.}} Shown is the distance from the origin ($O$) during pre-, mid-, and post-SWR periods (*\textit{p} $<$ 0.05, **\textit{p} $<$ 0.01, ***\textit{p} $<$ 0.001; assessed using the Brunner--Munzel test). Abbreviations: SWR, sharp-wave ripple events; eSWR, SWR during the encoding phase; rSWR, SWR while in the retrieval phase; SWR$^+$, positive SWR event; SWR$^-$, control events for SWR$^+$; pre-, mid-, or post-SWR denote the time intervals from $-800$ to $-250$ ms, from $-250$ to $+250$ ms, or from $+250$ to $+800$ ms, all relative to the center of the SWR.
