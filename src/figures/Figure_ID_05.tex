\caption{\textbf{Transient Changes in Neural Trajectory During SWR}}
\smallskip
\\
\textbf{\textit{A.}} Depicts the average distance from the origin ($O$) of the peri-sharp-wave-ripple (SWR) trajectory, alongside a 95\% confidence interval, which may not be evident due to its limited range \cite{girardeau_selective_2009,norman_hippocampal_2019,buzsaki_hippocampal_2015}. \textbf{\textit{B.}} Demonstrates the distance from the origin ($O$) throughout pre-, mid-, and post-SWR intervals (*\textit{p} $<$ 0.05, **\textit{p} $<$ 0.01, ***\textit{p} $<$ 0.001; according to the Brunner--Munzel test \cite{boran_persistent_2019}). The defined terms are: SWR, sharp-wave ripple events; eSWR, SWR occurring during the encoding phase; rSWR, SWR taking place during the retrieval phase; SWR$^+$, an SWR event; SWR$^-$, the control events aligned with SWR$^+$; pre-, mid-, or post-SWR, the time segments from $-800$ to $-250$ ms, from $-250$ to $+250$ ms, and from $+250$ to $+800$ ms, respectively, each relative to the SWR center.
