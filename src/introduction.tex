\section{Introduction}
Working memory (WM) significantly influences everyday life, and the neural bases of this cognitive process continue to be the subject of intensive research. One key focus of this research is the hippocampus, a structure integral to memory functions \cite{scoville_loss_1957} \cite{squire_legacy_2009}  \cite{boran_persistent_2019} \cite{kaminski_persistently_2017} \cite{kornblith_persistent_2017} \cite{faraut_dataset_2018} \cite{borders_hippocampus_2022} \cite{li_functional_2023} \cite{dimakopoulos_information_2022}. A deeper understanding of the hippocampus's role in working memory is not only crucial for advancing our knowledge but also potentially for enhancing cognitive abilities.

Current evidence suggests that a transient, synchronized oscillation, called sharp-wave ripple (SWR) \cite{buzsaki_hippocampal_2015}, is associated with several cognitive functions. These include memory replay \cite{wilson_reactivation_1994} \cite{nadasdy_replay_1999} \cite{lee_memory_2002} \cite{diba_forward_2007} \cite{davidson_hippocampal_2009}, memory consolidation \cite{girardeau_selective_2009} \cite{ego-stengel_disruption_2010} \cite{fernandez-ruiz_long-duration_2019} \cite{kim_corticalhippocampal_2022}, memory recall \cite{wu_hippocampal_2017} \cite{norman_hippocampal_2019} \cite{norman_hippocampal_2021}, and neural plasticity \cite{behrens_induction_2005} \cite{norimoto_hippocampal_2018}. These associations suggest that SWR may be a fundamental computational manifestation of hippocampal processing, contributing to working memory performance as well. However, research on the effects of SWRs on working memory is relatively scarce \cite{jadhav_awake_2012}, and is predominantly limited to rodent models engaged in navigation tasks, where the timing of memory acquisition and recall is not clearly defined.

Recent studies have found low-dimensional representations in the hippocampal neurons can explain WM task performances. Specifically, the firing patterns of place cells \cite{okeefe_hippocampus_1971} \cite{okeefe_place_1976} \cite{ekstrom_cellular_2003} \cite{kjelstrup_finite_2008} \cite{harvey_intracellular_2009}, found in the hippocampus, have been identified within a dynamic, nonlinear three-dimensional hyperbolic space in rats \cite{zhang_hippocampal_2022}. Additionally, grid cells in the entorhinal cortex (EC), which is the main pathway to the hippocampus \cite{naber_reciprocal_2001} \cite{van_strien_anatomy_2009} \cite{strange_functional_2014}, exhibited a toroidal geometry during exploration in rats \cite{gardner_toroidal_2022}. However, these studies are limited by their focus on spatial navigation tasks in rodents, affecting the temporal resolution of WM tasks. To illustrate, the timing of when an animal acquires information is ambiguous in these settings. Therefore, the applicability of these findings to human subjects and tasks beyond navigation still requires confirmation.

Considering these factors, this study investigates the hypothesis that hippocampal neurons show unique 'neural trajectories' in low-dimensional spaces, particularly during SWR periods, in response to WM tasks. To test this hypothesis, we employed a dataset of patients performing an eight-second Sternberg task (1 s for fixation, 2 s for encoding, 3 s for maintenance, and 2 s for retrieval) with high temporal resolution. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) signals within the medial temporal lobe (MTL) were recorded for these patients \cite{boran_dataset_2020}. To examine low-dimensional neural trajectories, we utilized Gaussian-process factor analysis (GPFA), an established method for analyzing neural population dynamics \cite{yu_gaussian-process_2009}.
