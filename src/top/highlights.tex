\item Neural trajectory in the hippocampus showed greater variations during a WM task compared to EC and amygdala regions.
\item The distance of neural trajectory in the hippocampus between encoding and retrieval states were memory-load dependent.
\item Hippocampal neural trajectory fluctuated between the encoding and retrieval states in a task-dependent manner
\item Hippocampal neural trajectory shifted from encoding to retrieval states during sharp-wave ripple event
