The figure details the positions of the electrodes along with the seizure onset zones. The regions labeled with an "o" symbol are included in the study, while the ones marked with an "x" (\textit{navy}) are excluded from the dataset. For the sake of brevity, the following abbreviations are utilized: AHL signifies the left hippocampal head, AHR the right hippocampal head, PHL the left hippocampal body, PHR the right hippocampal body, ECL the left entorhinal cortex, ECR the right entorhinal cortex, AL the left amygdala, AR the right amygdala, and SOZ represents the seizure onset zone \cite{boran_dataset_2020}.
