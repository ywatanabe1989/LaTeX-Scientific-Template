This figure annotates the positions of the electrodes and the seizure onset zones. Regions marked with an "o" symbol are included, whereas those designated by an "x" (\textit{navy}) are omitted from the dataset. The following abbreviations are used: AHL refers to the left hippocampal head, AHR to the right hippocampal head, PHL to the left hippocampal body, PHR to the right hippocampal body, ECL to the left entorhinal cortex, ECR to the right entorhinal cortex, AL to the left amygdala, AR to the right amygdala, and SOZ to the seizure onset zone \cite{boran_dataset_2020}.
