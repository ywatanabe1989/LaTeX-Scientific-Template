\caption{\textbf{Electrode Positioning within the Dataset}}

\\
The figure illustrates the positions of the electrodes alongside the seizure onset zones. The regions denoted with an "o" symbol are incorporated into the study, whereas the ones designated with an "x" (\textit{navy}) have been excluded from the dataset. To ensure brevity, we employ the following abbreviations: AHL denotes the left hippocampal head, AHR the right hippocampal head, PHL the left hippocampal body, PHR the right hippocampal body, ECL the left entorhinal cortex, ECR signifies the right entorhinal cortex, AL the left amygdala, AR is the right amygdala, and SOZ refers to the seizure onset zone \cite{boran_dataset_2020}.
