This figure depicts the locations of the electrodes as well as the seizure onset zones. The regions marked by an "o" denote their inclusion in the dataset, while those identified by an "x" (\textit{in navy}) are absent. The abbreviations used are: AHL, left hippocampal head; AHR, right hippocampal head; PHL, left hippocampal body; PHR, right hippocampal body; ECL, left entorhinal cortex; ECR, right entorhinal cortex; AL, left amygdala; AR, right amygdala; and SOZ, which stands for seizure onset zone.
