Silhouette score comparison of UMAP clustering between $SWR^+$ candidates and $SWR^-$ candidates

\\
The silhouette scores (mean $\pm$ SD across sessions by subject) of UMAP clustering for SWR$^+$ candidates and SWR$^-$ candidates (Figure 4A) were derived from their underlying multiunit spike patterns. The mean values were recorded as 0.205 (SD = 0.285), with a median within an interquartile range (IQR; Figure 4B) \cite{mcinnes_umap_2018, rousseeuw_silhouettes_1987}.
