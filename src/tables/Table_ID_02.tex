Comparative Analysis of Silhouette Scores in UMAP Clustering of $SWR^+$ and $SWR^-$ Candidates
}

\\
We measured the silhouette scores (mean $\pm$ SD across sessions for individual subjects) for both SWR$^+$ and SWR$^-$ candidates in UMAP clustering, derived from their underlying multispikes (Figure 4A). The mean score was registered as 0.205 (SD = 0.285), and the median fell within an inter-quartile range (IQR; Figure 4B) \cite{mcinnes_umap_2018, rousseeuw_silhouettes_1987}.
