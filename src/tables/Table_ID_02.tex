Comparative Analysis of Silhouette Scores in UMAP Clustering for $SWR^+$ and $SWR^-$ Candidates
}
\smallskip
\\
Silhouette scores (mean $\pm$ standard deviation, SD) across sessions were calculated for each subject, for both $SWR^+$ and $SWR^-$ candidates in UMAP clustering, based on associated multispikes (Figure 4A). The mean score recorded was 0.205 (SD = 0.285), and the median fell within the inter-quartile range (IQR; Figure 4B) \cite{mcinnes_umap_2018, rousseeuw_silhouettes_1987}.
