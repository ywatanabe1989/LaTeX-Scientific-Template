Comparative Analysis of Silhouette Scores in UMAP Clustering for $SWR^+$ and $SWR^-$ Candidates
}
\smallskip
\\
We calculated the silhouette scores (mean $\pm$ SD across sessions for each subject) for both the $SWR^+$ and $SWR^-$ candidates in UMAP clustering. These were determined based on their associated multispikes (Figure 4A). The mean score was recorded as 0.205 (SD = 0.285), and the median was within the inter-quartile range (IQR; Figure 4B) \cite{mcinnes_umap_2018, rousseeuw_silhouettes_1987}.
