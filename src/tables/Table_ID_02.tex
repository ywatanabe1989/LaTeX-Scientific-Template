Silhouette score of UMAP clustering for $SWR^+$ candidates and $SWR^-$ candidates

\\
The silhouette scores (mean ± SD across sessions per subject) for UMAP clustering of SWR+ candidates and SWR− candidates (Figure 4A) were calculated based on their corresponding multiunit spike patterns (mean values were 0.205 [0.285], median [IQR]; Figure 4B).
