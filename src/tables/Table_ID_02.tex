Silhouette score of UMAP clustering for $SWR^+$ candidates and $SWR^-$ candidates

\\
The silhouette scores (mean ± SD across sessions per subject) for UMAP clustering of SWR+ candidates and SWR− candidates were computed from the corresponding multiunit spike patterns. The mean values were 0.205, with a standard deviation of 0.285, and median [IQR]; (Figure 4A and 4B).
