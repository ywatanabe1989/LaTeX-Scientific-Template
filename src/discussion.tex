\section{Discussion}
This study hypothesizes that in low-dimensional spaces during a working memory (WM) task in humans, hippocampal neurons form unique trajectories, primarily during sharp wave-ripple (SWR) periods. Initially, multiunit spikes in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions were projected onto three-dimensional spaces during a Sternberg task using Gaussian-process factor analysis (GPFA) (Figure~\ref{fig:01}D --- E and Figure~\ref{fig:02}A). The trajectory distance across WM phases ($\mathrm{\lVert g_{F}g_{E} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{F}g_{M} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{F}g_{R} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{E}g_{M} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{E}g_{R} \rVert}$, and $\mathrm{\lVert g_{M}g_{R} \rVert}$) was significantly larger in the hippocampus compared to the entorhinal cortex (EC) and amygdala (Figure~\ref{fig:02}E), indicating dynamic neural activity in the hippocampus during the WM task. Also, in the hippocampus, the trajectory distance between the encoding and retrieval phases ($\mathrm{\lVert g_{F}g_{E} \rVert}$) correlated positively with memory load (Figure~\ref{fig:03}C --- D), reflecting WM processing. The hippocampal neural trajectory transiently expanded during SWRs (Figure~\ref{fig:05}). Lastly, the hippocampal neural trajectory alternated between encoding and retrieval states, transitioning from encoding to retrieval during SWR events (Figure~\ref{fig:07}). These findings explain aspects of hippocampal neural activity during a WM task in humans and offer [FIXME>]new insights into SWRs as a state-switching element in hippocampal neural states[<FIXME].

The distance of the neural trajectory across the phases was significantly longer in the hippocampus compared to the EC and amygdala, when considering the distance from $O$ in these regions (Figure~\ref{fig:02}C --- E). This establishes the involvement of the hippocampus in the WM task, corroborating previous studies indicating hippocampal persistent firing during the maintenance phase \cite{boran_persistent_2019} \cite{kaminski_persistently_2017} \cite{kornblith_persistent_2017} \cite{faraut_dataset_2018}. However, applying GPFA to multiunit activity during a one-second level resolution of the WM task revealed that the neural trajectory in low-dimensional space presented a memory-load dependency between the encoding and retrieval phases, denoted as $\mathrm{\lVert g_{E}g_{R} \rVert}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:03}). These findings support the association of the hippocampus with WM processing.

Our analysis focused on putative Cornu Ammonis (CA)1 regions (Figure~\ref{fig:04}), reinforced by several factors. This specific focus results from established observations that SWRs synchronize with interneuron and pyramidal neuron spike bursts \cite{buzsaki_two-stage_1989} \cite{quyen_cell_2008} \cite{royer_control_2012} \cite{hajos_input-output_2013}, potentially within a 50 $\mu$m radius of the recording site \cite{schomburg_spiking_2012}. Furthermore, we identified an increased incidence of SWRs during the first 0--400 ms of the retrieval phase (Figure~\ref{fig:04}D). This finding aligns with previous reports of heightened SWR occurrence preceding spontaneous verbal recall \cite{norman_hippocampal_2019} \cite{norman_hippocampal_2021}, supporting our results under a triggered retrieval condition. The observed log-normal distributions of both SWR duration and ripple band peak amplitude in this study (Figure~\ref{fig:04}C \& E) coincide with the current consensus in this field \cite{liu_consensus_2022}. Consequently, our decision to limit recording sites to putative CA1 regions likely contributed to improving the precision, or true positive rate, of SWR detection. Although, the trajectory distance increase from $O$ during SWRs (Figure~\ref{fig:05}) might be artificially inflated towards higher values due to channel selection, this potential bias does not substantially challenge our main findings.

Interestingly, during the retrieval phase, trajectory directions alternated between encoding and retrieval states during both baseline and SWR periods in a task-dependent manner (Figure~\ref{fig:07}C \& D). Additionally, the balance of this oscillation transitioned from encoding to retrieval state during SWR events (Figure~\ref{fig:07} E \& F). These results align with previous studies on the role of SWR in memory retrieval \cite{norman_hippocampal_2019} \cite{norman_hippocampal_2021}. Our findings introduce a novel understanding indicating that SWRs occur when the hippocampal representation transitions from encoding to retrieval states. Therefore, these results reveal novel aspects of hippocampal representations, including (i) neuronal oscillation between encoding and retrieval states during a WM task and (ii) SWR serving as a transition trigger for changing neural states.

Moreover, our study noted differences specific to the WM-task type between encoding- and retrieval-SWRs (Figure~\ref{fig:07}E--F). Notably, opposing movements of encoding-SWR (eSWR) and retrieval-SWR (rSWR) were not observed in the Match IN task but were apparent in the Mismatch OUT task. Memory engram theory \cite{liu_optogenetic_2012} might explain these observations: the Match In task presented participants with previously shown letters, while the Mismatch OUT task introduced a new letter absent in the encoding phase. This explanation underscores the significant role of SWR in human cognitive processes.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that during a WM task, hippocampal activity oscillates between encoding and retrieval states and transitions uniquely from encoding to retrieval during SWR events. These findings provide significant insights into the neural correlates and functionality of working memory in the hippocampus.
