\section{Results}
\subsection{iEEG recording and neural trajectory in MTL regions during a Sternberg task}
We employed a publicly available dataset \cite{boran_dataset_2020} for our analysis, which comprises LFP signals (Figure 1A) from MTL regions (Table~\ref{tab:01}1) recorded during a modified Sternberg task. SWR$^+$ candidates were identified in all hippocampal regions obtained from the LFP signals, filtered by the ripple band (80--140 Hz) (Figure 1B). SWR$^-$ candidates were delineated at the same timestamps as SWR$^+$ candidates but scrambled across different trials (Figure 1). The dataset also encompasses the multiunit spikes (Figure 1C), which were specified through the application of a spike sorting algorithm \cite{niediek_reliable_2016}. Using the 50-ms binned multiunit activity without overlaps, we deployed GPFA \cite{yu_gaussian-process_2009} to unravel the neural trajectory (or factors) of MTL regions by session and region (Figure 1D). Each factor was z-normalized by session and region (an example being session \#2 in AHL of subject \#1). The Euclidean distance from the origin ($O$) was then calculated (Figure 1E).

\subsection{Hippocampal neural trajectory correlation with a Sternberg task}
Figure 2A defines the median neural trajectories of 50 trials as point clouds within the three principal factor space. Using the elbow method, we established that the ideal embedding dimension for the GPFA model was three (Figure 2B). The trajectory distance from the origin ($O$) ($\mathrm{\lVert g_{F} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{E} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{M} \rVert}$, and $\mathrm{\lVert g_{R} \rVert}$) was larger in the hippocampus than in the EC and amygdala (Figure 2C \& D).

Similarly, the distances between geometric medians of the four phases, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{F}g_{E} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{F}g_{M} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{F}g_{R} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{E}g_{M} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{E}g_{R} \rVert}$, and $\mathrm{\lVert g_{M}g_{R} \rVert}$, were computed. It was observed that the hippocampus exhibited greater distances among the phases compared to the EC and amygdala. 

\subsection{Memory load-dependent neural trajectory distance between the encoding and retrieval states in the hippocampus}
With consideration given to the memory load of the Sternberg task, it was observed that the correct trial rate and set size (equalling the number of alphabet letter to encode) negatively correlated (Figure 3A). Similarly, a positive correlation was evident between response time and set size (Figure 3B). Also, the set size and the trajectory distance between the encoding and retrieval phases ($\mathrm{log_{10}\lVert g_{E}g_{R} \rVert}$) showed a positive relationship (Figure 3C). However, distances between other phase combinations exhibited no significant correlations (Figures 3D \& S2).

\subsection{Detection of hippocampal SWR from putative CA1 regions}
To enhance the precision of recording sites and SWR detection, we attempted to estimate electrodes in CA1 regions of the hippocampus by observing distinct multiunit spike patterns during SWR incidents. For each session and hippocampal region, SWR$^+$/SWR$^-$ candidates were embedded into a two-dimensional space using UMAP (Figure 4A). The silhouette score was determined as a measure of clustering quality (Figure 4B \& Table~\ref{tab:02}). Recording sites with an average silhouette score across sessions more significant than 0.6 were recognized as putative CA1 regions \cite{mcinnes_umap_2018, rousseeuw_silhouettes_1987}. Thus, we identified five putative CA1 regions, four of which were not previously labelled seizure onset zones (Table~\ref{tab:01}).

Next, we marked SWR$^+$/SWR$^-$ candidates within these putative CA1 regions as SWR$^+$ and SWR$^-$, respectively. Both SWR$^+$ and SWR$^-$ showed the same duration. A significant increase in SWR$^+$ incidence emerged during the initial 400 ms of the retrieval phase. Furthermore, the peak ripple band amplitude of SWR$^+$ was higher than that of SWR$^-$.

\subsection{Transient change in neural trajectory in the hippocampus during SWR}
We analyzed the \textit{distances} of the trajectory from origin ($O$) during SWR events in both encoding and retrieval phases (Figure 5A). Upon observing the increase in distance during SWR (Figure 5A), we categorized each SWR into three states: pre-, mid-, and post-SWR. 

\subsection{Visualization of hippocampal neural trajectory during SWR in two-dimensional spaces}
Based on our observations of the neural trajectory 'jump' during SWR (Figure 5), we visualized the three-dimensional trajectories of pre-, mid-, and post-SWR events during the encoding and retrieval phases (Figure 6). For this visualization, we positioned $\mathrm{g_{E}}$ at the origin (0, 0) and $\mathrm{g_{R}}$ at the coordinate ($\mathrm{\lVert g_{E}g_{R} \rVert}$, 0) in two-dimensional spaces by linearly aligning peri-SWR trajectories. 

\subsection{Fluctuating hippocampal neural trajectories between encoding and retrieval states}
Subsequently, we inspected the trajectory \textit{directions} based on $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{g_{E}g_{R}}}$. Directions of SWRs were identified by the neural trajectory at $-250$ ms and $+250$ ms from their center (i.e., $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{eSWR^+}}$). From this data, we computed the density of $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{eSWR}} \cdot \overrightarrow{\mathrm{g_{E}g_{R}}}$, $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{rSWR}} \cdot \overrightarrow{\mathrm{g_{E}g_{R}}}$, and $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{eSWR}} \cdot \overrightarrow{\mathrm{rSWR}}$ (Figure 7A--D).
